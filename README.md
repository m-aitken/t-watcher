### Overview

**You’ve come a long way, and it's time to show it.** This will be your most advanced project to date, and if you put creativity into it, it'll hopefully be the thing you want to show off most prominently in your portfolio.

**You get to call the shots and invent your own idea**, choosing a framework & tools that are appropriate for what you want to build. Pull from everything you've learned so far, and **tackle something that'll push you a little outside of your comfort zone.**

Make sure you review your project proposal with your instructor so you can make sure it's **something you can accomplish in the limited time we have**, and make sure it's **something that'll be impressive visually**. Sometimes people do judge a book by its cover – or an app by its design.

** T-Watcher : Lookup Twitch channels, view live streams!

After recently giving a 'TEDtalk' like presentation on the Twitch video streaming platform, I had it on the brain and decided to make a lightweight stream viewer.

I researched the Twitch Developer sire for API resources & Docs, and also found they provide guidance and resources for branding (colour scheme, logo images etc).


My first portfolio project utilised colours and fonts to imitate the old terminal-like interfaces, which I really enjoyed putting together.
For this project, I've referenced Google Font 'Press Start 2P': stylised as old font used in original NAMCO console games.
