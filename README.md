**GA project intro**
Youâ€™ve come a long way, and it's time to show it. This will be your most advanced project to date, and if you put creativity into it, it'll hopefully be the thing you want to show off most prominently in your portfolio.

### Overview

**T-Watcher : Display your fave Twitch channels, watch live streams!

After recently giving a 'TEDtalk' like presentation on the Twitch video streaming platform, I had it on the brain and decided to make a lightweight stream viewer.

I researched the Twitch Developer site and found their API offering, reference Documentation and also guidance and resources for their provided branding(colour scheme, logo images etc).
I've used the official Twitch logo offered on their 'brand' resources page, and ensured I'm using the precise colour RGB scheme!

My first GA portfolio project utilised colours and fonts to imitate the old terminal-like interfaces, which I really enjoyed putting together. For this project, I wanted to continue with the 'old school' theme.
To aid this I've referenced Google Font 'Press Start 2P' (stylised as old font used in original NAMCO arcade games) and simple button styling and colours.

**Technologies used:

*Twitch API, freely provided at their Developer Portal.
*BootstrapCSS has been referenced for use in creating the layout and styling(e.g. buttons).
*I've included 'Animate.css' library for a special effect on the main logo. 
*Custom font'Press Start 2P' referenced from Google Fonts 
*My code utilises the jQuery library, making use of ajax requests to update content on my main page.
