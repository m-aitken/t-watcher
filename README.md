### Overview

**Youâ€™ve come a long way, and it's time to show it.** This will be your most advanced project to date, and if you put creativity into it, it'll hopefully be the thing you want to show off most prominently in your portfolio.

**T-Watcher : Lookup Twitch channels, view live streams!

After recently giving a 'TEDtalk' like presentation on the Twitch video streaming platform, I had it on the brain and decided to make a lightweight stream viewer.

I researched the Twitch Developer site for API resources & Docs, and also found they provide guidance and resources for branding (colour scheme, logo images etc).

My first GA portfolio project utilised colours and fonts to imitate the old terminal-like interfaces, which I really enjoyed putting together.
For this project, I've referenced Google Font 'Press Start 2P': stylised as old font used in original NAMCO console games.
